lcd image buffer

    purpose is to help keep track of what is being displayed
    is this a relevant concern? would keeping track of the cursor
    be more effective? i need an example

    entering into a menu.. see the following
    
    1 - Back    2 - Inspect

    3 - Serial  3 - I/O

    This can be accomplished by clearing the screen
    (cursor starts at location 0)
    and then writing the string shown above.

    it has to do with how i expect the end user to use CompuStart.
    the way i see it working is not having an end program that will
    be run from the ROM but moreso from RAM. like a never finished 
    project. its perpetually experimental.
    i would need to devise an appropiate programming environment
    for it then.


    PERFECT

    lets see

    nothing here is ment to be permanent.
    design a pcb/software program
    learn

    deanna and michael produce two modules
    kento and i make the software and some ui
    hija makes the power solution
    valentin makes the pcb with michael

    main issue right now is building libraries for ROM or for
    RAM. building for RAM is convenient because I can edit the
    libraries as needed, that is, without having to program
    the ROM chip again.
