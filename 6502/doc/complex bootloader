i want to have a timeout for the bootloader to signal
the end of the data i need to recieve.

i should also be sure to check the amount of data
versus the amount of space left. if it is more data
than can be stored, i should probably terminate the
process and display an error message on the lcd and
also on the serial port. in ascii

jump table per type of irq
